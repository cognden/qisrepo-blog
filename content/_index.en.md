  > - Think positive, no matter how hard your life is.
  > - God does not look at your appearance and possessions, but He looks at your heart and actions.
  > - A rational human being is a human being who likes to receive and ask for advice.
  > - This world is like a shadow. If you try to catch it, it will run away. But if you turn your back on him, he has no choice but to follow you.
